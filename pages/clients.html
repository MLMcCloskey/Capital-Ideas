        <em>I’ve had the pleasure of working with Nicole for nearly three years and she is hands down the best product consultant I’ve ever worked with. Nicole is dependable, accurate, and plays very close attention to the smallest details. Nicole is my “go to” when it comes to ordering premium items. She is a pleasure to work with and I would give her my highest recommendation as a phenomenal product consultant and consummate marketing professional.</em>

        <em>Thank you for all the hard work and strategic thinking that went into choosing and delivering on the 2010 Coppertone premium program. It was your personal strategic consult and time that got us the “right premium” for the job. The usual pen and/or mug wouldn’t have gotten it done. I look forward to your counsel and help on our 2011 Coppertone business. I feel confident that you’ll help us find “the next great premium” custom to the Coppertone business.</em>

        <em>I want to thank you very much for your work on our Red Hat Partner awards. The partners and everyone who saw them thought they were fantastic.

        <em>Thank you so much for your creative ideas, and for helping to make our Zegerid OTC launch a success within our organization!! All of your initiatives were fantastic – from the shadowboxes to the View Masters to the Jellybean Jars. They all went a long way in spreading the news about our new product to internal and external partners. And the lightning-fast turnaround on all of the projects was incredible!
            It’s a pleasure working with you and your team. Thanks again for everything!</em>
